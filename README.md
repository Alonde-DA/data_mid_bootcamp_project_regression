# Case study: Regression - Ironhack Mid bootcamp project

## Introduction
This project was prepared by the team of: **Athina, Iago and Olga** working together as analysts for a real estate company. **The objective** was to understand and analyse the features which determine the selling price of a house and to create a machine learning model which predicts those prices. 

**Dataset:** 
The dataset (available in the repository folder *dataset*) consists of information on 22,000 properties which were sold between May 2014 and May 2015. 


**Repository:** This repository was created in order to present the results of our work. It consists of: 

1. **Dataset folder** - containing *csv* and *xls* files with the dataset used for the analysis. 
2. **Slides deck** - slides prepared for our public presentation of the project 
3. **Python code** - Jupyter Notebook file containing Python code with machine learning models
4. **SQL queries** - with required queries (to be used on the house_price_regression database) 
5. **A Tableau Dashboard** - dashboard contains answers to questions which were asked in the task. It also contains an interactive, easy to use dashboard which might help business stakeholders in analysing the data.

## Python code 
Jupyter Notebook contains Python code written to explore the data and to test and train the linear regression model used to predict the selling prices of houses. 
1. Dataset - initial checks
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Benchmark model - linear regression model 
4. Feature engineering (data scaling)
5. Feature selection
6. Improving the model
